                        <span>
                            Please note that we will not provide any build files or source code for the projects we develop. This decision is made to protect our intellectual property and ensure the integrity of the services we offer. Instead, we will provide you with a hosted link that allows you to access and utilize the services delivered in a secure and efficient manner. This approach ensures that all clients have a consistent experience and minimizes the risk of unauthorized use or distribution of our proprietary materials.<br /><br />
                            We understand that access to build files may be important for some clients, but we believe that delivering a hosted solution best serves the interests of both parties. If you have specific needs or requests regarding project files, we encourage you to discuss them with us prior to the commencement of the project, and we will do our best to accommodate your needs within the framework of our policies.

                                <span>Payments made for services are considered non-refundable once the agreed-upon scope of work has been initiated or delivered. Clients are encouraged to thoroughly review the service details and confirm their acceptance before the commencement of any work to ensure alignment on expectations.</span>

                                <span>Given that the services we provide are specifically tailored to meet individual client needs, refunds will not be issued once development or implementation has commenced. This customization process involves significant resources and planning, and therefore we ask clients to make informed decisions prior to this stage.</span>

                                <span>Any advance payments or deposits made at the start of a project are non-refundable under any circumstances. This policy applies even in cases where the client decides to cancel the project after payment. Clients should consider this policy when agreeing to terms and making initial payments.</span>

                                <span>Clients wishing to cancel their project must submit a request within 2 days prior to the start date of the project milestone. Requests made after this window will not be eligible for refunds. This policy ensures that we can adequately allocate our resources and manage project timelines effectively.</span>
